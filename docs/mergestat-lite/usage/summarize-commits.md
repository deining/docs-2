```bash
mergestat summarize commits --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

```

Note the use of the `--repo` flag, which sets the default repository (to either a local path on disk, or a remote repository).
If not provided, the current directory will be used (if it's a git repo).

### Filtering Files

The first argument to `mergestat summarize commits` will be interpreted as a file path pattern.
This will limit the query to **only commits that modify files matching the pattern**.
For instance:

```bash
# Only show stats for commits that modify markdown files
mergestat summarize commits %.md --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

Will only show a summary of commits that modified files with a `.md` extension (typically Markdown files).
Similarly:

```bash
# Only show stats for commits that modified cmd/root.go
mergestat summarize commits cmd/root.go --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

Will only look at commits that modify a specific file.

### Filtering With Time Ranges

You may pass the `--start` and `--end` flags to provide a time range to bound commits to.
This allows you to look at stats for various periods throughout the history of a repo.
The expected format is `YYYY-MM-DD`, but SQLite *[date modifiers](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)* may also be passed, instead of an exact date.
This allows you to easily express **relative date ranges**, such as `--start "-6 months"` (only include commits authored within the last 6 months).

```bash
# Only show stats for commits authored in the last 30 days
mergestat summarize commits --start "-30 days" --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

```bash
# Only show stats for commits authored in the 30 day period, starting 60 days ago
mergestat summarize commits --start "-60 days" --end "-30 days" --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

```bash
# Only show stats for commits authored this year
mergestat summarize commits --start "start of year" --repo "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat"
```

You may pass the `--json` flag to output results as `json`, which is useful for script consumption.
