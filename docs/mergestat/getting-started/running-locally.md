# Running Locally

Start by cloning the [`mergestat/mergestat`](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat/) repository to a local directory.
`cd` into the root of the repository and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

That should be sufficient to bring up a local instance of MergeStat ðŸŽ‰.
To access the management console, visit [`http://localhost:3300/`](http://localhost:3300/)
