In this post we'll show how [MergeStat](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat) can be used in conjunction with [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec), a static analysis tool for [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), to secure cloud infrastructure üõ°Ô∏è.

As a reminder, [MergeStat](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat) accesses git repos, runs an analysis on them, and stores the results in SQL for downstream querying and operationalization:

In this post, we'll show how [our integration](https://github.com/mergestat/syncs/tree/main/syncs/scan-tfsec) with [`tfsec`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) can be used to build a report in Grafana.
The end result of this example is a TFSec Grafana dashboard that looks like this

This dashboard is available as a JSON export [here](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat/tree/main/examples/git/security/tfsec/grafana).

## The Setup

To begin scanning IaC repos with MergeStat, you'll need a MergeStat instance.
You can start locally by following [these instructions](/mergestat/getting-started/running-locally) to get a Docker Compose instance running.

Next, you'll want to add the `ghcr.io/mergestat/sync-scan-tfsec` sync to your MergeStat instance:
