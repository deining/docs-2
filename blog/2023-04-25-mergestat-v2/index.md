# Announcing V2: Extract & Sync Anything ðŸš€

We're thrilled to announce the release of MergeStat v2, a completely new approach to extracting and syncing data from Git repositories and into SQL! ðŸŽ‰

MergeStat's mission has always been to enable anyone to ask and answer questions about *anything* involved in building and shipping software.
Today we're taking a major step closer to that reality, by supporting *container-based* syncs.

That means all the data sources MergeStat supports are now defined as OCI containers, and live in a separate repo: [`mergestat/syncs`](https://github.com/mergestat/syncs).

By externalizing our sync implementations, adding and using new data sources is now much easier.
This means working with data from open-source code scanners such as [`gosec`](https://github.com/mergestat/syncs/tree/main/syncs/scan-gosec) can be implemented *outside* the main MergeStat repo!

## Additional Notes

- Container syncs require that our worker run in Docker privileged mode for now.
- GitHub API syncs now use the [`octokit` SDK](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/), which automatically handles request retries.
- Currently, syncs in private Docker registries are yet supported.
