Previously, we looked at a [few ways we can look at open-source library risk across our code](../2023-02-19-identifiying-open-source-risk-part-1/index.md). In this article, we‚Äôll look at how we can search for new *known* vulnerabilities once details become available. 

So, an email, article or colleague disrupts whatever you were doing and proclaims ‚ÄúXYZ library is vulnerable and it‚Äôs horrible!‚Äù. How do you tell if you‚Äôre vulnerable to XYZ vulnerability?

If you can query your code, you can start finding where you might be exploitable. If you‚Äôre new to [MergeStat](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat), the `tldr` is it's a tool to aggregate multiple Git sources, organisations and repos in a literal SQL interface (with some other magic sauce utilities too)

In this case, let‚Äôs take a look at Log4Shell. Here‚Äôs a rundown of the advisory: [https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a) 

One of their first steps was *‚ÄúIdentifying assets affected by Log4Shell and other Log4j-related vulnerabilities‚Äù*

Now, assets is going to involve a lot of things that are off the shelf, but from a ‚Äúknowing our code‚Äù angle there‚Äôs a few things we can do.

Our high-level process using [MergeStat](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat) to identify potential locations is pretty simple:

1. Find all locations where we might include Log4J. In this example, we‚Äôll look at the the package manager maven)
2. Search for Log4J (we can get more specific, but let‚Äôs start here)
3. Find the last author or committer who touched the file to assist with assessing and remediation

Find all the maven package manager files

```sql
SELECT repo, path 
FROM git_files
INNER JOIN repos ON git_files.repo_id = repos.id
WHERE path LIKE '%pom.xml'
```

We‚Äôre going to get something that looks like the following

| repo | path |
| --- | --- |
| https://github.com/ORG-A/repo1 | service-discovery/blah/pom.xml |
| https://git.internal.xyz/TEAM-B/repoY | pom.xml |
| ... | ... |

That‚Äôs pretty straight forward, but what we really want is to find all the maven files which look like they use Log4J.

```sql
SELECT repo, path 
FROM git_files
INNER JOIN repos ON git_files.repo_id = repos.id
WHERE path LIKE '%pom.xml' AND contents LIKE '%log4j%'
```

This will produce a similar table result as above, this time with files that contain Log4J. Now, this is pretty broad keyword search, but if you take a look at the [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/maven-artifacts.html) documentation this should catch most of the situations where Log4J appears, even if you change the package manager filename (e.g. `build.gradle`, `build.sbt` etc) and even the [Clojure build tool](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build) if that‚Äôs your thing.  

Now to find out who can help us determine if we‚Äôre actually vulnerable. Hopefully we have a version number in the `pom.xml` or equivalent build tool. If we have to dive deeper to check deployment status then we probably need to find the last person who touched the package manager file. 

Here‚Äôs a query to find all developers and committers who last modified the maven files which look like they use Log4J:

```sql
--- TODO(amenowanna) this needs some help
SELECT repo, auth_empath 
FROM git_files
INNER JOIN repos ON git_files.repo_id = repos.id
WHERE path LIKE '%pom.xml' AND contents LIKE '%log4j%'
AND "SOME OTHER QUERY I NEED To thiNK ABOUT"
```

## What are the limitations of this process?

**This example is only Maven, it doesn‚Äôt include other ecosystems (but could)**

The above process and queries could be easily tweaked to query Gradle, Scala build tool and other JVM based languages or integrations. You could run your analysis on `build.gradle` or whatever your JVM package manager file is. As above take a look at the [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/maven-artifacts.html) and [Clojure build tool](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build) documentation for some other package managers. 

**It may be included in another library as a dependency (AKA Transitive Dependency)**

This one is a bit trickier. If we don‚Äôt have that extracted and queryable already, we would then need to query the broader libraries and check if they use the library. However, we can at least start from a ‚Äúwhere are all the maven, gradle, sbt etc‚Äù package manager files and run the analysis from that starting point. 

**We‚Äôre only looking at our code, what about 3rd party and COTS?** 

The above won‚Äôt help with ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù software that has something like Log4J bundled (e.g. Tomcat, or a commercial application built on top of Tomcat). Most likely, these will be discovered using other vulnerability management tools looking at virtual machines or containers.

**This code may not be actually deployed**

Is it test code? Proof of Concept? Decommissioned? 

Who knows? At least you have a starting point with some names to start asking questions. As above, if you find the last author or committer and ask them you can then rule in or out whether it‚Äôs an issue for you. 

**It may be fixed in code, but not released to production**

To actually confirm we‚Äôre not vulnerable across our organisation and applications, we still need to check the deployed artefact. We have the starting point of code, but can then follow up through developers we found who‚Äôve updated those files. 

## Next Steps

As you can see, being able to query your code is extremely useful when looking for something which is ‚Äúknown bad‚Äù.  We can quickly query our code bases to start the initial analysis of our posture. We‚Äôve used Log4J here, but these types of queries could be used for Dockerfiles (e.g. some binary install through curl that‚Äôs compromised, different added packages with vulnerabilities), other language package managers (e.g. Ruby Gems, Python pip, Go mod etc).
